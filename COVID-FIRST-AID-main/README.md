# COVID-FIRST-AID
Our project encompasses a multi-domain functional device. It helps covid patient to measure their vitals and accordingly get admitted to the hospital with ease having the worst condition among the other patients. In this model we have built a prototype of the aforementioned device. It consists of several sensors like MAX30102 is an integrated pulse oximetry and heart-rate monitor biosensor module to measure the heart rate and oxygen level, the temperature sensor to measure the temperature and the BMP280 pressure sensor to measure the lung capacity of the patient. Following this the readings will directly be fed into an application and directly sent to the respective doctors. If the doctor thinks the patient should be admitted, he/she gets a bed according to his/her condition with respect to his fellow patients. If the doctor thinks the patient can be cured in the home, then whatever medicines are recommended are directly send to the pharmacy which is nearest to the patientâ€™s home and gets home delivered. The patient can then make online payment for the medicine through the app only.
